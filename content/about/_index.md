title: "About us"

heading_1: "It began with a paintbrush and a vision"
desc_1: "In 1982 Robbie Pyle opened up a sign shop, where every sign was meticulously hand-lettered. As the industry evolved, Robbie put his paintbrush away and mastered digital media. He also sought out business partners who shared his vision. Now, more than 25 years after the first brush stroke was made, ImageFX is a leader in digital design, printing, brand conversions and environmental branding."

heading_2: "Robbie"
desc_2: "While some kids were setting up lemonade stands, Robbie was impressing customers with his hand painting and lettering. Thanks to his passion and talent, Robbie had his own sign business before he was old enough to drive. Robbie's expertise and ImageFX, the company he founded, continue to evolve to meet the needs of clients. His drive has kept him at the top of his game, both in the business arena and on the racetrack. When Robbie isn't creating winning designs for his clients, he's racing in the American Speed Association (ASA) where he still competes at a very high level."
